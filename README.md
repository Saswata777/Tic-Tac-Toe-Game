# Tic Tac Toe



1. Game Title: Tic-Tac-Toe Game
   - A classic two-player game implemented using JavaScript, where players take turns marking spaces on a grid to achieve a winning pattern.

2. Game Description:
   - The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a simple and popular game where two players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, aiming to create a winning pattern of their symbols.

3. Objective:
   - The objective of the game is to be the first player to create a line of three of their symbols (either X or O) vertically, horizontally, or diagonally on the grid.

4. Game Features:
   - The game board consists of a 3x3 grid where players make their moves.
   - Two players take turns, one marking X and the other marking O on the grid.
   - Players can select an empty space on the grid to mark their symbol.
   - The game validates the moves and checks for winning patterns after each turn.
   - If a player creates a line of three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, they win the game.
   - The game may include features such as a visual indication of the winning pattern or a tie game if the grid is filled without a winner.

5. Game Controls:
   - Players can interact with the game by clicking or tapping on the empty spaces of the grid to make their moves.

6. Game Logic:
   - The game keeps track of the current player's turn, the grid state, and checks for winning patterns.
   - After each move, the game checks if a player has achieved a winning pattern or if the game is a tie.
   - If a winning pattern is detected or the game is a tie, the game ends, and the winner (if any) is declared.

7. Scoring System:
   - The game may include a scoring system to keep track of the number of wins for each player.

8. Game Over:
   - When the game is over, the winner (if any) is declared, and players have the option to play again or exit the game.

9. Dependencies:
   - The game may require dependencies such as a JavaScript framework or library for DOM manipulation, or a CSS framework for styling.
